                <p>
                    I hear you shouting at me this question. "WHY?!" you shout.
                    People. Calm down. I'm right in front of you. Let me explain.<br>
                    Simply put: I like to yap but I don't like traditional social media. This is the year 
                    2024 and I have grown up in the age of Instagram and algorithm driven feeds. I want to break 
                    free of this. I want to have my own space that is truly authentic. So, this is my solution, clunky as it may be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Basically what I'm thinking is: if I've got the knowledge to build a website why don't I?
                    I could use this thing to just post stuff. It feels more satisfying and customizable. 
                    More personal. Also, more flexible. There's only so much personality you can put into an
                    Instagram page after all. This site is ALL me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I plan to use this main page as a place to post <strong>BIG</strong> updates about my life or about
                    the site. Most of the writing will take place in the monthly tabs found on the nifty left nav bar!
